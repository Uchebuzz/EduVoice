📘 EduVoice – AI Agent for PDF-to-Audio Accessibility
Making Reading Accessible for Everyone

5 day Agentic AI Competition for ** Slater_ Team**

EduVoice is an AI-powered agent designed to convert PDFs into high-quality voice recordings, enabling blind and visually impaired learners to access written content easily and independently.

🚨 Problem Statement

Millions of blind and visually impaired people struggle with one core challenge:

Most educational material is locked inside PDFs — inaccessible without assistance.

Not all PDFs are screen-reader friendly. Many contain:

Two-column layouts

Images with text

Dense academic formatting

Unlabelled headings

Complex diagrams

Traditional screen readers fail or read content in the wrong order, making learning exhausting or impossible.

EduNarrator aims to solve this by giving visually impaired learners a way to “hear” any PDF, effortlessly.

🎯 Solution Overview

EduVoice is an agentic AI system that:

- Reads any PDF

- Extracts and cleans the text

- Understands the structure

- Converts the content into natural, human-sounding speech

- Outputs a single MP3 that can be listened to anywhere

It allows blind learners to:

- Study books and notes

- Review lecture slides

- Revise through audio

- Access inaccessible PDFs

Learn independently without waiting for assistance
